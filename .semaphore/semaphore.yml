# An agent defines the environment in which your code runs.
# It is a combination of one of available machine types and operating
# system images.

# Blocks are the heart of a pipeline and are executed sequentially.
# Each block has a task that defines one or more jobs. Jobs define the
# commands to execute.
# See https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/62-concepts
blocks:

          # job is to work with your code.
          - checkout

          # Set version of Go:
          - sem-version go 1.16

          # Download dependencies and build the project:
          - go get github.com/lib/pq
          - go build webServer.go
